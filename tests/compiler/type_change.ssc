// As of the time this was written, SeaScript cannot directly reference strings like "Hello, World!"
// So we have to use the global function `to_string` to convert an integer to a string.

global var = to_string(150); // -> "150"

var = 100; // set var, which was previously a string to an integer

print(var); // -> 100
